### Money Streaming

Money streaming represents the idea of continuous payments over time. Block numbers are used to measure time in the blockchain and continuously update the balances of the parties in the contract. Head over to the **[Whitepaper](https://docs.meanfi.com/platform/specifications/money-streaming-protocol)** for more details.

The Money Streaming Program is an implementation of the protocol built and deployed on the Solana blockchain, with address `MSPCUMbLfy2MeT6geLMMzrUkv1Tx88XRApaVRdyxTuu` on [Mainnet Beta](https://explorer.solana.com/address/MSPCUMbLfy2MeT6geLMMzrUkv1Tx88XRApaVRdyxTuu).
